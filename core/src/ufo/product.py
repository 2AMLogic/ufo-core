"""Where each workspace stands in the product funnel, counted onto the fleet's metrics every tick.

Every stage is already a row — a connector grant, a member's turn, an agent a member built — so
nothing here is stored and no event has to be caught as it happens. A stage redefined next month
re-derives itself over the whole history on the next tick, which is the property that makes the
funnel worth deriving rather than shipping as events.

The census runs once per workspace per tick, under the workspace the dispatcher bound, so the number
of workspaces at a stage is what one tick's increments add up to. A board therefore counts a stage
out of one bucket `PRODUCT_CENSUS_SECONDS` wide, which holds exactly one tick, and never out of a
bucket Datadog sizes for itself, which counts one workspace once per tick it covers. Every query
names `workspace_id` itself rather than leaning on RLS to filter it, as every other core read does:
one workspace's rows counted under another's binding would multiply every number on the board rather
than fail.

Stages are a ladder: a workspace that chatted also counts as seated, so each stage's total is at
most the one above it and the whole funnel reads off one series. What a workspace has attached is
counted beside it as a `kind` and a `name` taken straight off the column — the surface, the
credential slot, the connector's provider, the app's name — so core counts Slack, GitHub, iMessage
and every bring-your-own-key connector without holding one of their names. A surface that is bound
and a surface a member can actually be reached on are different facts, so a proved address is its
own kind rather than the installation's.

Beside the funnel, the same tick counts each setup step a workspace took and how long the step took
to arrive. A stage says a workspace got there; a step says when, so the board reads where a slow
setup stalls a team rather than only how many teams stalled. A milestone step is derived exactly
like a stage — the earliest row that marks it — and counted on the one tick its first row lands in,
which is what makes one workspace's step one count forever rather than one per tick since. A step
that leaves no row cannot be derived, so `record_onboarding_step` counts the two that do not: an
extension's onboarding step failing under `ufoctl init`, and a first-run screen a member skipped or
walked out of. Neither a member nor a workspace is a tag anywhere here — a step, its status, the
surface it happened on, and the provider it attached are the whole tag set, so the series stays one
per step whatever the fleet's size. The member-frequency count also stays aggregate: core combines
direct turns and folded arrivals because extensions cannot read either runtime-owned table, then
exports only the workspace's qualifying count.

A stage or step marked by a row an extension owns is that extension's `CensusSpec`: its `first_at`
joins core's own reads in the census's one transaction and is counted by the same rules."""
