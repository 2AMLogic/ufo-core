"""Deploy routes and operator commands: an extension's reach for the deploy's own services and its
operator, and the `DeployContext` both run with.

A deploy route answers a service of the deploy — a sign-in gateway, a control plane — never a
member's browser, so it binds no workspace until its handler names one. A command is the same reach
from `ufoctl`. Both are core because the reads they need cross workspaces through the owner pool,
which no extension may open, and the seat they write runs `Provisioning`, whose founded handlers
only core may run. The points are privileged: first-party distributions only."""
